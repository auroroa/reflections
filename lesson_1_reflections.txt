What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    automatically saved is needn't you commit manually,and it's version is confusion
    manually commit need you commit manually every time,and view it is clearly

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    一次保存多个文件，可以使得整个工程的逻辑更加清晰，比如一个功能点的改动涉及到几个问题，本次 commit 逻辑上应该包含多个文件。

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First, use 'git log' to get the history change record, find the version ids, and use 'git diff first_id second_id' to get the different.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    版本可以恢复到历史的任意时间节点，很容易定位引起错误的提交，同时使用 'git diff first_id second_id' 找出更改内容。
